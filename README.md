Kotlin Solutions for code signal 
--------------------------------

purpose:
Since the beginning of my journey as a newbie programmer , I always had difficulties to find solutions . I used to wonder why most of the time I had a exceeding time limit or how some of theses Questions work. As I started learning more and more; I have discovered that there are a lot more efficent ways to write codes.The only thing that could have been more helpful would have been to find .kt solutions. 

Notes:
 - a quick note that some of the questions from THE CORE (17 .. 24) may not  include kotlin within them. so I used java to solve them
 - I'm still learning so propbably you will find my solutions very long or not efficent enough (feel free to pull and edit it as you wish)
 - In the current time of me writitng this not All the tasks have been solved ... hopefully I will do soon
